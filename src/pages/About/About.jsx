                We are a family-run guest house in Nordeste, SÃ£o Miguel, 
                originally built in the 1960s by Paulo Borges and Filomena Teixeira - a humble couple who made 
                a living through agriculture and sewing always trying developing the house regarding the modern days. Today, their legacy lives on through our guest house, 
                which offers a unique and peaceful retreat surrounded by nature.
